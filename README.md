Exploratory Analysis of a data set

## Description

This just a fun way of challenging myself to do new and difficult things. The dataset is the same star wars data set that comes in R.
I downloaded it from kaggle(link at bottom). I explored the data and tried to extract information as easily as possible, without having
to skim columns and row myself. I also put a lot of effort into trying to write good comments on the code. I didn't want to write what
the code did as much as I wanted to write why it was there. I think it was a good attempt, but there's definitely room for improvement.
One thing I wish I added was some visualiations, I think that would be neat. Maybe I will add some.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I only used pandas
* import pandas as pd

## Advice

I made a mistake when getting the count of unique homeworlds. There is not 77 unique home worlds(in the dataset).
