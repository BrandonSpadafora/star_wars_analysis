Exploratory Analysis of a data set

## Description

This just a fun way of challenging myself to do new and difficult things. The dataset is the same star wars data set that comes in R.
I downloaded it from kaggle(link at bottom)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I only used pandas
* import pandas as pd

## Advice

I made a mistake when getting the count of unique homeworlds. There is not 77 unique home worlds(in the dataset).
